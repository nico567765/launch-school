palindromes are case sensitive

smaller palindromes within larger ones should be treated as new palindromes

return palindromes as items in an array

if string is empty, return empty array

if no palindromes are found return empty array

questions:

the palindromes don't seem to be real words, but 
simply letter patterns which are the same forwards and backwards,
ask if this is the case
Better question: what is a 'substring'? What is a 'palindrome' here?

what about numbers and symbols?

what if given something that is not a string? verification?
LS: Will inputs always be strings


input: given a string

output: array of all palindrome substrings of input string
