given a hash whose keys are names and values are sub-hashes of the person of
that name's details.
Modify each person's sub-hash to add an age_group key pointing to the age category they are in.

the ranges are (0..17) == kid, (18..64) == adult, >= 65 == senior

setting age group:
if (0..17).include?(munsters[name]["age"])
  age_group = 'kid'
elsif (18..64).include?(...)
  age_group = 'adult'
elsif munsters[name]["age"] >= 65
  age_group = 'senior'
end

munsters[name]["age_group"] = age_group

algo:
- Given a hash.
- Iterate over the hash's pairs
- On each iteration set the age group for the person represented by the k-v pair
- Add key "age_group" to their subhash and assign to the age_group already set
- Return hash
