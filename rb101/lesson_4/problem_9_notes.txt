Problem: given a string. Capitalize every word in the string. Retain original spaces

the string needs to be split into words. each word can then be capitalized.
the words then need to be substituted in to their place in the string in a new copy
of the string.

algo

- Given a string
- Split the string on spaces into new array called words
- Capitalize each word in words into a new array capital_words
- Substitute capitalized words for original words in a copy of string
- Return new capitalized string

implementation details:
Substitute step needs further thought
- Substitute capitalized words for original words in a copy of string
the capital_words collection needs to be iterated over and the copy of
the string to be modified word by word until every word has been replaced with its
capital form
