On your own ideas
Below are some extra ideas you may want to explore on your own. They're too challenging and 
out of scope for this course, but may be worth exploring for the adventurous programmer.

Minimax algorithm

You can build an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe by utilizing the minimax algorithm.

Bigger board

What happens if the board is 5x5 instead of 3x3? What about a 9x9 board?

More players

When you have a bigger board, you can perhaps add more than 2 players. Would it be interesting 
to play against 2 computers? What about 2 human players against a computer?
