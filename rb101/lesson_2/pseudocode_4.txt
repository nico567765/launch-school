casual:

Given a string and a target character.

Declare a counter which will be used for iteration and for keeping track of successive indexed characters in the string.

Declare a counter to keep track of instances of the target character within the string.

Iterate over each character in the string:
  -if the current character is the same as the target character, increment the target instance counter
  -if the instance counter is 3, save the current string index counter value

If the iteration has finished and the target instance counter is < 3, set the index counter value to nil

Return the saved index value

formal:

START

# Given a string called "text" and a target character called "target"

SET iterator = 0
SET instances = 0

WHILE iterator < length of text
  IF character in text at space "iterator" == target
    SET instances = instances + 1
  
  IF instances == 3
    SET result = iterator
  
  iterator = iterator + 1

IF instances < 3
  SET result = nil

PRINT result
