casual:

Given a collection of integers.

Declare an empty collection.
Declare an integer to act as a counter for iteration.

Iterate through the original collection of integers.
  - for every odd-numbered iteration through the collection, as determined by the integer division of the counter by 2:
    - append the current integer value from the original collection to the new collection
  - for every even-numbered iteration through the collection, pass to the next iteration.

After iterating through the original collection, return the new collection.

formal:

START

# Given a collection of integers called "numbers"

SET selected_numbers = an empty collection
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < length of numbers
  IF iterator / 2 yields a non-zero remainder
    append the value in numbers at space "iterator" to selected_numbers collection
  
  SET iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT selected_numbers
