casual:

Given two collections of numbers of equal length, called "numbers_1" and "numbers_2".

Declare an empty collection called "target_numbers".
Declare a counter.

Iterate while counter < the length of the given collections
  - if the counter is even
    - append to target_numbers the value in numbers_1 at space "counter"
  - otherwise append to target_numbers the value in numbers_2 at space "counter"

Return target_numbers

START

# Given two equally-sized collections of numbers, "numbers_1" and "numbers_2"

SET target_numbers = empty array
SET counter = 0

WHILE counter < length of numbers_1
  IF counter is even
    READ value in numbers_1 at space "counter"
    SET target_numbers to append this value from numbers_1
  ELSE
    READ value in numbers_2 at space "counter"
    SET target_numbers to append this value from numbers_2

PRINT target_numbers
